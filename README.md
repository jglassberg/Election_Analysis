- The county with the highest turnout was Denver with 82.8% of the voter turnout and 306,055 votes.

## Challenge Summary

The code written for the Colorado Board of Elections can be utilized by any election so long as the data 
is adapted accordingly and the new file is linked to the code. 

For example, any election board can come in with their data and have it imported to the existing code by 
restructuring the file_to_load command with the corresponding file title. 

Additionally if this was to be used on a national level, any analyst could restructure the county indexes 
to states indexes to capture the data on a state-wide level to under stand the voter tunrout or percentages accordingly.
